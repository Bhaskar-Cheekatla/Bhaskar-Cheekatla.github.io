      <b>Suitable factors required for the cultivation of Onion  are : 1. Temperature, 2. Rainfall, 3. Soils, 4. Fertilizers  and 5.Labour ! </b><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Temperature: <img id="anime" src="images/temperature.png"></h2>
    <p>Onion is a temperate crop but can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions.The optimum temperature for vegetative phase and bulb development is 13-24˚C and 16-25˚C, respectively.</p>
    
    <h2>Rainfall:<img id="anime" src="images/rainfall.png"></h2>
    <p> It requires about 70% relative humidity for good growth. It can grow well in places where the average annual rainfall is 650-750 mm with good distribution during the monsoon period. Areas with low (< 650 mm) or heavy rainfall (>750 mm) are not particularly suitable for rain-fed crop.</p>
    <h2>Soils:<img id="anime" src="images/soil.png"></h2>
    <p>Onion can be grown in all types of soils such as sandy loam, clay loam, silt loam and heavy soils. However, the best soil for successful onion cultivation is deep, friable loam and alluvial soils with good drainage, moisture holding capacity and sufficient organic matter.</p>
    
     <h2>Fertilizers:<img id="anime" src="images/fertilizers.png"></h2>
     <p>Onion need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium .One third of recommended N and full dose of P2O5 and K2O are applied at the time of planting while remaining two third N is applied in two equal splits at 30 and 45 days after planting.</p>
    
     <h2>Labour:<img id="anime" src="images/labour.png"style="height: 150px;"></h2>
     <p>Harvesting, grading, and packaging – Harvesting is done 3 months from sowing. Harvesting a one-acre onion farm is mostly done in a single day. This requires 6 labourers.</p>
