      <b>  Suitable graphical conditions required for wheat cultivation are : 1. Temperature, 2. Rainfall, 3. Soils, 4. Topography and 5.Technology! </b><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Temperature: <img id="anime" src="images/temperature.png"></h2>
    <p>The temperature required for wheat during growing season is around 15.5°C. The weather should be warm and moist during the early stage of growth and sunny and dry in the later stages.</p>
    
    <h2>Rainfall:<img id="anime" src="images/rainfall.png"></h2>
    <p>The amount of rainfall required for wheat cultivation varies between 30 cm and 100 cm. The major wheat lands of the temperate regions have an annual rainfall of 38 cm to 80 cm. 
        Wheat is also grown in areas having lesser amount of rainfall, i.e., 25 cm. This has been done by adopting dry farming method. Also where irrigation facil­ities are available, wheat is cultivated in dry lands also.
    </p>
    <h2>Soils:<img id="anime" src="images/soil.png"></h2>
    <p>The soil suitable for wheat is either light clay or heavy loam. The world’s best wheat comes from the chernozem soils in the ‘Black Earth’ region of the Ukrainian Steppes, the dark brown soil of North America and also the grey brown podzolic soils of the deciduous forest region.</p>
    
     <h2>Topography:<img id="anime" src="images/topography.png"></h2>
     <p>Wheat is grown in plain as well as in rolling topography, which provides adequate drainage and at the same time facilities of the use of machiner</p>
    
     <h2>Technology:<img id="anime" src="images/technology.png"></h2>
     <p>In wheat cultivation maximum use of technology is possible. The commercial wheat farming is technology-intensive cultivation which requires tractors, harvesters, threshers, elevators, etc.</p>
