      <b>Suitable factors required for the cultivation of Tomato are : 1. Temperature, 2. Rainfall, 3. Soils, 4. Fertilizers  and 5.Labour ! </b><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Temperature: <img id="anime" src="images/temperature.png"></h2>
    <p>Tomato is a warm season crop. The best fruit colour and quality is obtained at a temperature range of 21-24°C. Temperatures above 32o C adversely affects the fruit set and development.</p>
    
    <h2>Rainfall:<img id="anime" src="images/rainfall.png"></h2>
    <p> It requires a low to medium rainfall. It can’t be grown successfully in places of higher rainfall. Also where irrigation facil­ities are available, Tomato is cultivated in dry lands also.</p>
    <h2>Soils:<img id="anime" src="images/soil.png"></h2>
    <p>Tomato can be grown on a wide range of soils from sandy to heavy clay. However, well-drained, sandy or red loam soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 are considered as ideal.</p>
    
     <h2>Fertilizers:<img id="anime" src="images/fertilizers.png"></h2>
     <p>Tomatoes need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (often abbreviated as npk) to fuel leaf, root, and fruit development. The best tomato fertilizer should also include calcium, magnesium, and other trace elements. Tomatoes are big feeders, but high amounts of nitrogen can lead to excess production of leaves at the cost of fruit production.</p>
    
     <h2>Labour:<img id="anime" src="images/labour.png"style="height: 150px;"></h2>
     <p>An average of 16 laborers is required every 15 days for various tasks in the field. Labour is necessary for seed treatment,ploughing ,transplanting,Fertilizing and harvesting.
