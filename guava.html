      <b>  Suitable factors required for the cultivation of Guava are : 1. Temperature, 2. Rainfall, 3. Soils, 4. Fertilizers  and 5.Labour ! </b><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Temperature: <img id="anime"  src="temperature.png"></h2>
    <p>Guava trees are well adapted to warm subtropical to tropical climatic conditions. Ideal temperatures for growth and production range from 73° to 82°F (23–28 g). Temperatures below 60°F or drought cause growth to slow or cease.</p>
    
    <h2>Rainfall:<img id="anime"  src="rainfall.png"></h2>
    <p>Dry moderate winter and summer coupled with an annual rainfall of 1000 mm is ideal for its growth and development.Guava can be successfully grown under tropical and sub-tropical climate up to an altitude of 1000-1500 m msl.</p>
    <h2>Soils:<img id="anime"  src="soil.png"></h2>
    <p>The importance of guava is due to the fact that it is a hardy plant, which can be grown on wide varieties of soils including shallow, medium black and alkaline soil. However, it grows successfully on well-drained soils with atleast 0.5 to 1m in depth.</p>
    
     <h2>Fertilizers:<img id="anime"  src="fertilizers.png"></h2>
     <p>Organic manure, phosphorus and potash and half dose of nitrogen should be applied during June-July and the remaining quantity applied in October-November. The optimum leaf nutrient status fixed for guava is 1.7% N, 0.5% 1.3% K,2.1% Ca, 0.46% Mg, 10.0 B, 77.5 ppm Zn and 75.0 ppm Cu.</p>
    
     <h2>Labour:<img id="anime"  src="labour.png"style="height: 150px;"></h2>
     <p>Growing Guava is, in general,  not a labour intensive. only 2 labours required for guava cultivation .
