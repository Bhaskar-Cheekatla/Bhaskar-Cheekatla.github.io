      <b>  Suitable factors required for the cultivation of  Potato are : 1. Temperature, 2. Rainfall, 3. Soils, 4. Fertilizers  and 5.Labour ! </b><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Temperature: <img id="anime" src="temperature.png"></h2>
    <p>Potato is a temperate climate crop, however it grows under a diverse range of climatic conditions. It is grown only under such conditions where the temperature during the growing seasons is moderately
        cool. The vegetative growth of the plant is best at a temperature of 24°C while tuber development is
        favoured at 20°C.</p>
    
    <h2>Rainfall:<img id="anime" src="rainfall.png"></h2>
    <p>Potato is mostly grown as a rainfed crop in regions receiving a rainfall of 1200 – 2000 mm per annum. Planting is done during October – November in plains. </p>
    <h2>Soils:<img id="anime" src="soil.png"></h2>
    <p>The potato can be grown almost on any type of soil except saline and alkaline soils. Soils, which are
        naturally loose, offer least resistance to the enlargement of the tubers is preferred. Loamy and sandy
        loam soils, rich in organic matter with good drainage and aeration are most suitable for cultivation of
        potato crop. The soil with pH range of 5.2-6.4 is considered to be ideal.
        </p>
     <h2>Fertilizers:<img id="anime" src="fertilizers.png"></h2>
     <p>A fertilizer dose of 180-240 kg N, 60-90 kg P2 O5 and 85- 25 130 K2O per hectare is recommended for alluvial soils of Indo Gangetic plains. In the hill zone, the 2 application of 100-150 kg N, 100-150 kg P2 O5 and 50-100 kg K2O per hectare is recommended.</p>
    
     <h2>Labour:<img id="anime" src="labour.png"style="height: 150px;"></h2>
     <p> Potato being a labour-intensive crop requires about 145 man days for cultivation of 1 ha of land.
