      <b>  Suitable factors required for the cultivation of  Brinjal are : 1. Temperature, 2. Rainfall, 3. Soils, 4. Fertilizers  and 5.Labour ! </b><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Temperature: <img id="anime" src="images/temperature.png"></h2>
    <p>Brinjal is a warm season crop and requires a long warm growing season. It is very susceptible to frost. A daily mean temperature of 13-21 oC is most favourable for its successful production. The growth of the crop is severely affected when temperature falls below 17 oC.</p>
    
    <h2>Rainfall:<img id="anime" src="images/rainfall.png"></h2>
    <p>It flourishes well in areas receiving a moderate rainfall ranging form 600-1000 mm. It cannot withstand excessive rainfall especially during flowering and fruit set. Excessive rainfall brings about defoliation, wilting and rotting of the plant. </p>
    <h2>Soils:<img id="anime" src="images/soil.png"></h2>
    <p>A deep fertile, well-drained, silt loam or clay loam soil with a pH of 5.5 to 6.0 is the best for cultivation of brinjal.In heavy clay soils and light soils, it is desirable to add well decomposed farm yard manure (FYM) 20-25 tonnes/ha and incorporated atleast two weeks before transplanting.</p>
    
     <h2>Fertilizers:<img id="anime" src="images/fertilizers.png"></h2>
     <p>Under normal soil, 150kg N and 100kg P2O5 is optimum. For a balanced nutrition, 30-60kg K2O is included in fertilizer package of brinjal in most the states. 1/3N, full P and full K should be applied as basal dose and remaining N in two split does at 25days and 45 days after transplanting.</p>
    
     <h2>Labour:<img id="anime" src="images/labour.png"style="height: 150px;"></h2>
     <p>For Brinjal  Farming, We need 2 labour for every 15 days.Labours requirement for 1 acre is 16. labours for Sowing,transpalnting,intercultural operations,spraying and harvesting.</p>
