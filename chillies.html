      <b>  Suitable factors required for the cultivation of  Chillies are : 1. Temperature, 2. Rainfall, 3. Soils, 4. Fertilizers  and 5.Technology ! </b><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Temperature: <img id="anime" src="temperature.png"></h2>
    <p>Chilli is a tropical and subtropical type of plant, and it requires a combination of a warm and humid environment to grow. The ideal temperature is considered 20-25°C. Temperatures above 37⁰C adversely effects chilli plant growth. However, for fruit maturity, dry weather is ideal.</p>
    
    <h2>Rainfall:<img id="anime" src="rainfall.png"></h2>
    <p>Chilli crop is raised as rainfed crop where the amount of annual rainfall is around 80-100 cm and well distributed.A well-drained, well-aerated, fairly light fertile loam with a fair moisture holding capacity is ideal. </p>
    <h2>Soils:<img id="anime" src="soil.png"></h2>
    <p>An ideal soil for chilli is light loamy or sandy loam rich in lime and organic matters. Strongly acid and alkaline soils are not suitable for chilli growing.</p>
    
     <h2>Fertilizers:<img id="anime" src="fertilizers.png"></h2>
     <p>Nitrogen requirement for chillies is 120 kg/ha. Apply 30 Kg basally before planting. Apply the balance , on 30,60 and 90 days after transplanting at equal doses of 30 Kg each and irrigate.</p>
    
     <h2>Technology:<img id="anime" src="technology.png"style="height: 150px;"></h2>
     <p>The various machineries have been adopted by farmers for chilli production. The tractor, power tiller, mini tiller, trailers and cleaner equipments consume 49.50%, 105, 5.5%, 30% and 4%, respectively. </p>
